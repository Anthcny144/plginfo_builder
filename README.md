# plginfobuilder
A program to build the plginfo file file used in a 3gx plugin

# Usage
```
plginfo_builder <input.3gx>
```
Or simply drag your 3gx file on the executable

# Compatibility
Works with every plugin built with 3gxtool from version 1.0 to 1.2<br>
If there is any new 3gxtool version that breaks the program, I will try to update it<br>
