# plginfobuilder
A program to approximately rebuild the plginfo file used to build a [3gx plugin](https://github.com/PabloMK7/CTRPluginFramework-BlankTemplate) using [3gxtool](https://gitlab.com/thepixellizeross/3gxtool)

# Usage
```
plginfo_builder <input.3gx>
```
Or simply drag your 3gx file on the executable

# Compatibility
ASCII characters above 0x7F are not transcribed correctly<br>
Works with every plugin built with 3gxtool from version 1.0 to 1.2<br>
If there is any new 3gxtool version that breaks the program, I will try to update it<br>
